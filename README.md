# 🌀 Secret Shuffle

A fun little fan-made tool to help players play the **Shuffle mini-game** in Snooker — where each player gets a **secret ball color** to keep the game fair and surprising!

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. Select the number of players and how many balls each gets.
2. Each player taps **"Show"** to secretly reveal their ball(s).
3. All selections are revealed at the end — only if you want!

## 🎯 What’s This For?

This tool is built just for the **Shuffle** mode inside Snooker.  
It ensures secrecy, avoids confusion, and keeps things fair by:
- Randomly assigning colored balls 🎱
- Secretly showing them to each player
- Letting players prove their original pick at the end
