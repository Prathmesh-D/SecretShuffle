# 🎱 Snooker Shuffle – Let the Balls Decide!

Welcome to **Snooker Shuffle** — a fun little tool built just for the mini-game inside Snooker where each player gets a **secret colored ball**. No one knows who has what… until the big reveal at the end! 😮

It's fair. It's fun. It's snooker with a twist.
